The zip file contains three files - fgl.c, parsers.h, and source.mak.

When 'fgl.c' file in fgl.zip is compiled with exuberant ctags source files, which you can download, ctags(executable) will generate tags for functions, cursor ids, prepared statements id, and global/module level variables. I compiled exuberant ctags source in AIX and Linux without any problem. Only trouble I faced was that source codes in ctags-5.4 tar file had DOS line breaks and had to translate them to UNIX line breaks using dos2unix utility.

If you use taglist.vim, add the following lines in taglist.vim script. 
Scroll down the script to a section where tag types are defined for different languages:
